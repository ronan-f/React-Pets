## React-Pets

Basic React project mostly used to learn about hooks. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/btholt">Brian Holt</a>.

The app queries a pet API which responds with a list of pets that are currently available for adoption. For this version only Seattle and San Francisco are supported.
